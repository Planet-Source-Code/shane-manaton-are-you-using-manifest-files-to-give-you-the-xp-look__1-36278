### Source Code

```
I wasnt sure if i should post this or not but figured if it only helps a couple of people then it was worth it
The Problem:
When you add a radio button to a frame it appears 'Blacked out', if you add it to a form then it is fine but if you are coding property pages then you loose the option groupings, this can be a real nightmare!
The Fix:
Its very simple and most of you with this problem have probably figured this out, If you add your frame to the form and then a PicturBox with no border and the same BackColor, add your option buttons to the picturebox control and the groupings will now work
Hope this helps someone!!
